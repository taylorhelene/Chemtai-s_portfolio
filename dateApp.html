            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Category</strong>: App design</li>
              <li><strong>Client</strong>: Individual</li>

            </ul>

            <p>
             DateSafi is the result of an end-to-end user experience project I undertook as a junior developer at 
             Techxers Kenya Limited.This study follows my journey from identifying a problem space, learning about 
             the problem, and creating a solution.
             <br>The problem: Many Kenyans needed help in interacting and finding life partners who had same interests
             ,desirable character traits and within their age group. Many of them have a busy life and tend to lack the 
             time to attend social gatherings. The various online dating platforms have a tendancy not to provide enough
             character description and no emphasis on the good attributes in people.

        </div>
        <div style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; ">
          <p>
            <br> Solution: DateSafi is an app that enables people to find their life partners. Starting with the name 
            itself, Datesafi aims to provide a platform where people on first access are given an onboarding on the 
            importance of having patience and other good attributes while searching for a prospective life partner, 
            they do have to provide details of what they expect in a life partner and a little bit of their personality
            will be outlined. The app will filter out people according to their choices and show feed according to their
            liking. It will provide messaging page for communication.
            <br>My Role: As a UI/UX team of two I was responsible for the :<br> ⁕Research
                                                                       <br> ⁕Ideation
                                                                       <br> ⁕Information Architechture
                                                                       <br> ⁕User Interface and visual design
                Through out the project, I incoporated invaluable feedback from my mentor, team mate, many people who use 
                dating apps and supervisor.

          <h3>My Process</h3>
          <p>My process employed a design thinking mindset, in which I focused first on learning about the problem space, through the discovery
            stages of understanding and empathy, then synthesizing what I had learned to define and frame the problem and finally creating the 
            solution.

            <h3>PHASE 1: LEARNING ABOUT THE PROBLEM </h3>
            <br>
            <h3>Understand</h3>
            
            <h4>◆Secondary research</h4>
            Looking into existing secondary research from existing dating apps, programs and websites
            to identify recent trends and patterns. Some notible insights marked increases in:
            <br> ▹Use of social sites for interactions
            <br> ▹Character and personality adress
            <br>
            <h4>◆Comparative analysis</h4>
            I followed up with a comparative analysis with Tinder,OkCupid and Bumble. While the focus was on dating, none of the
            applications brought up the issue of emphasizing on good personality traits.
            <br>
            <h3>Empathize</h3>
            
            <h4>◆Primary research</h4>
            I moved to primary research after a good unerstanding of the dating trends where I could learn directly 
            from people through interviews and one on one talks.Prior to setting this up ,I developed some goals:
            <br> ▹Discover the pain points in dating
            <br> ▹Determine the means people currently use to find their life partners
            <br> I selected six participants to interview and gained some invaluable insight into how various try to engage
            with prospective partners and their methods of determining their suited personality choice and these were their thoughts:
            <br>" I don't have the time to attend social gatherings"
            <br>" Some of us don't trust people on these social sites"
            <br>
            <h3>Define</h3>
            
            <h4>◆ Affinity map</h4>
            I set to work creating an affinity map after synthesizing my research notes
            <br>Three themes emerged:
            <br>*Focus on good character traits
            <br>*Focus on interests
            <br>*Focus on security based on age group
            <br>
            <h4>◆ Empathy maps </h4>
            I created empathy maps to organize information into what people feel.
            <br>
            <img src="assets/img/portfolio/empathymapdatesafi.png" alt="">
            <br>
            <h4>◆ Persona </h4>
            Personas were created from the empathy map which included individual goals,motivations,needs
            ,motivations,frustrations and environment
            <br>
            <h4>◆ Problem statement </h4>
            Finally the synthesis of the information also gave me the opportunity to redefine the problem
            into a more adressable problem :
            <br>People need a more moral and character attributed site that enables them to have a grasp of the 
            personality traits of a prospective life partner.
            <br>
            <h3>PHASE 2: CREATING A SOLUTION </h3>
            <br>
            <h3>Ideate</h3>
            
            <h4>◆ How might we...?</h4>
            I formulated how might we questions to adress the core element.
            <br>How might we make dating easy and empasise on the good personality traits.
            <br>
            <h4>◆ The idea</h4>
            DateSafi: A dating mobile app that enables people to find their life partners. Starting with the name 
            itself, Datesafi aims to provide a platform where people on first access are given an onboarding on the 
            importance of having patience and other good attributes while searching for a prospective life partner, 
            they do have to provide details of what they expect in a life partner and a little bit of their personality
            will be outlined. The app will filter out people according to their choices and show feed according to their
            liking. It will provide messaging page for communication.
            <br>
            <h3>Prototype</h3>
           
            <h4>◆ User Stories</h4>
            The first step is building a minimum viable product using User Stories,actions and epics.
            <br>
            <h4>◆ Information architecture</h4>
            I created a general structure using a user flow diagram. The improvised revisions would be
            later added to high fidelity prototype
            <br>
            <img src="assets/img/portfolio/userflowDatesafi.png" alt="">
            <br>
            <h4>◆ Sketching</h4>
            I sketched out the onboarding and screens needed for the app and turned it into low fidelity
            prototypes
            <br>
            <h4>◆ Wireframes</h4>
            I developed some low fidelity wireframes for more editing and feedback from my teammate. Any changes
            would be noted down and changed to better revisions and wireflows
            <br>
            <img src="assets/img/portfolio/wireflowdatesafi.png" alt="">
            <br>
            <h4>◆ Style Guide</h4>
            I created a style guide to illustrate the typefaces,colors and various UI elements that were applied in the design
            system. I wanted to achieve a fun and interactive look to stay relevant.
            <br><img src="assets/img/portfolio/styleguidedatesafi.png" alt="">
            <br>
            <h4>◆ Mockup</h4>
            We developed a high fidelity mockup that would be the base of the prototype
            <br><img src="assets/img/portfolio/DateSafitwo.png" alt="">
            <br><img src="assets/img/portfolio/Datesafitwoo.png" alt="">
            <br>
            <h3>Test</h3>
            <br>
            <h4>◆Usability testing</h4>
            Some people did not have the XD app installed on their phones so I had them testing on the application
            on the laptop
            <br><iframe width="420" height="315"

            </iframe>
           
            <br>
            <h3>Lessons learnt</h3>
            This project gave me great exposure on working on a full User Experience problem from start to completion.
            Each step was a learning opportunity and it gave me a learning foundation
