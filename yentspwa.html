            </ul>

            <p>
             Yen progressive web app is the result of an end-to-end user experience project I undertook as a software designer and developer at 
             Yen Africa.This study follows my journey from identifying a problem space, learning about 
             the problem, and creating a solution.
             <br>The problem: Many golfers within the club are usually interested in cryptocurrency and they would like a way to invest their money
             in a coin that would grow in value and earn them some interest while being a part of the golfing club.

          <p>
            <br> Solution: Yen progressive web app that enables golfers to transact and gain interest on their money while being able to conduct 
            payments for their various golfing activities.
            <br>My Role: As a UI/UX team of four I was responsible for the :<br> ⁕Research
                                                                       <br> ⁕Ideation
                                                                       <br> ⁕Information Architechture
                                                                       <br> ⁕User Interface and visual design
                Through out the project, I incoporated invaluable feedback from my mentor, team mates, many people who use 
                dating apps and supervisor.

          <h3>My Process</h3>
          <p>My process employed a design thinking mindset, in which I focused first on learning about the problem space, through the discovery
            stages of understanding and empathy, then synthesizing what I had learned to define and frame the problem and finally creating the 
            solution.

            <h3>PHASE 1: LEARNING ABOUT THE PROBLEM </h3>
            <br>
            <h3>Understand</h3>
            
            <h4>◆Secondary research</h4>
            Looking into existing secondary research from existing fintech apps, programs and websites
            to identify recent trends and patterns. Some notible insights marked increases in:
            <br> ▹Use of cryptocurrency sites to invest.
            <br> ▹Growth of interst in cryptocurrency
            <br>
            <h4>◆Comparative analysis</h4>
            I followed up with a comparative analysis with apps that deal with cryptocurrency.
            <br>
            <h3>Empathize</h3>
            
            <h4>◆Primary research</h4>
            I moved to primary research after a good unerstanding of the cryptocurrency trends where I could learn directly 
            from people through interviews and one on one talks.Prior to setting this up ,I developed some goals:
            <br> ▹Discover 
            <br> ▹Determine 
            <br> I selected six participants to interview and gained some invaluable insight into how 
            <br>" "
            <br>" "
            <br>
            <h3>Define</h3>
            
            <h4>◆ Affinity map</h4>
            I set to work creating an affinity map after synthesizing my research notes
            <br>Three themes emerged:
            <br>*Focus on investing
            <br>*Focus on cryptocurrency
            <br>*Focus on 
            <br>
            <h4>◆ Empathy maps </h4>
            I created empathy maps to organize information into what people feel.
            <br>
            <img src="" alt="">
            <br>
            <h4>◆ Persona </h4>
            Personas were created from the empathy map which included individual goals,motivations,needs
            ,motivations,frustrations and environment
            <br>
            <h4>◆ Problem statement </h4>
            Finally the synthesis of the information also gave me the opportunity to redefine the problem
            into a more adressable problem :
            <br>People need a more r.
            <br>
            <h3>PHASE 2: CREATING A SOLUTION </h3>
            <br>
            <h3>Ideate</h3>
            
            <h4>◆ How might we...?</h4>
            I formulated how might we questions to adress the core element.
            <br>How might we turn golfing into investing.
            <br>
            <h4>◆ The idea</h4>
            Yen progressive web app that enables golfers to transact and gain interest on their money while being able to conduct 
            payments for their various golfing activities.
            <br>
            <h3>Prototype</h3>
           
            <h4>◆ User Stories</h4>
            The first step is building a minimum viable product using User Stories,actions and epics.
            <br>
            <h4>◆ Information architecture</h4>
            I created a general structure using a user flow diagram. The improvised revisions would be
            later added to high fidelity prototype
            <br>
            <img src="" alt="">
            <br>
            <h4>◆ Sketching</h4>
            I sketched out the onboarding and screens needed for the app and turned it into low fidelity
            prototypes
            <br>
            <h4>◆ Wireframes</h4>
            I developed some low fidelity wireframes for more editing and feedback from my teammate. Any changes
            would be noted down and changed to better revisions and wireflows
            <br>
            <img src="" alt="">
            <br>
            <h4>◆ Style Guide</h4>
            I created a style guide to illustrate the typefaces,colors and various UI elements that were applied in the design
            system. I wanted to achieve a clean and minimalistic lookk.
            <br><img src="" alt="">
            <br>
            <h4>◆ Mockup</h4>
            We developed a high fidelity mockup that would be the base of the prototype
            <br><img src="assets/img/portfolio/yentstwo.png" alt="">
            <br>
            <br><img src="assets/img/portfolio/yentspwa.png" alt="">
            <br>
            <h3>Test</h3>
            <br>
            <h4>◆Usability testing</h4>
            Some people did not have the XD app installed on their phones so I had them testing on the application
            on the laptop
            <br>
          </p>

          <p>
            <br>
            <h3>Lessons learnt</h3>
            This project gave me great exposure on working on a full User Experience problem from start to completion.
            Each step was a learning opportunity and it gave me a learning foundation
