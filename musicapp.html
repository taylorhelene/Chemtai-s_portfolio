            <p>
              Mzikki application design is the result of an end-to-end user experience project I undertook as a challenge. 
              This study follows my journey from identifying a problem space, learning about the problem, and creating a solution.
              <br>The problem: Create a music app design that would be intergrated into a smart watch.

          <p>
            <br> Solution: Mzikki app and smart watch OS simple and minimalistic design .
            <br>My Role: As a UI/UX team of one I was responsible for the :
            <br> ⁕Research
            <br> ⁕Ideation
            <br> ⁕Information Architechture
            <br> ⁕User Interface and visual design
            <br>Through out the project, I incoporated invaluable feedback from my client.
            
            <br>My tools:<br>✔Sticky notes      &nbsp;&nbsp;     ✔Empathy map template
                         <br>✔moqup template     &nbsp;     ✔Pens  
                         <br>✔Adobe XD
                         <br>✔illustrator
                         <br>✔User story template
          </p>
          <h3>Process</h3>
          <p>My process employed a design thinking mindset, in which I focused first on learning about the problem space, through the discovery
            stages of understanding and empathy, then synthesizing what I had learned to define and frame the problem and finally creating the 
            solution.

            <h3>PHASE 1: LEARNING ABOUT THE PROBLEM </h3>
            <br>
            <h3>Understand</h3>
            
            <h4>◆Secondary research</h4>

            <br>Looking into existing existing music apps on both phones and smart watches to identify recent trends and patterns
            <br>
            <h4>◆Comparative analysis</h4>
            I followed up with a comparative analysis with Spotify and Mdundo.
            <br>
            <h3>Empathize</h3>
            
            <h4>◆Primary research</h4>
            I moved to primary research after a good understanding of the dating trends where I could learn directly 
            from people through interviews and one on one talks.Prior to setting this up ,I developed some goals:
            <br> ▹Transition from phone application to smart watch application
            
            <br>
            <h3>Define</h3>
            
            <h4>◆ Affinity map</h4>
            I set to work creating an affinity map after synthesizing my research notes
            <br>Two themes emerged:
            <br>*Focus on artists 
            <br>*Focus on music on play layout and seamless transition from IOS to smart watch OS
            <br>
            <h4>◆ Empathy maps </h4>
            I created empathy maps to organize information into what people feel.
            <br>
            <img src="" alt="">
            <br>
            <h4>◆ Persona </h4>
            Personas were created from the empathy map which included individual goals,motivations,needs
            ,motivations,frustrations and environment
            <br>
            <h4>◆ Problem statement </h4>
            Finally the synthesis of the information also gave me the opportunity to redefine the problem
            into a more adressable problem :
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>PHASE 2: CREATING A SOLUTION </h3>
            <br>
            <h3>Ideate</h3>
            
            <h4>◆ How might we...?</h4>
            I formulated how might we questions to address the core element.
            <br>How might we create a simple music application that will have seamless transition into the watch OS
            <br>
            <h4>◆ The idea</h4>
            Mzikki application and smart watch OS simple and minimalistic design 
            <br>
            <h3>Prototype</h3>
           
            <h4>◆ User Stories</h4>
            The first step is building a minimum viable product using User Stories,actions and epics.
            <br>
            <h4>◆ Information architecture</h4>
            I created a general structure using a user flow diagram. The improvised revisions would be
            later added to high fidelity prototype
            <br>
            <img src="" alt="">
            <br>
            <h4>◆ Sketching</h4>
            I sketched out the onboarding and screens needed for the app and turned it into low fidelity
            prototypes
            <br>
            <h4>◆ Wireframes</h4>
            I developed some low fidelity wireframes for more editing and feedback from my teammate. Any changes
            would be noted down and changed to better revisions and wireflows
            <br>
            <img src="" alt="">
            <br>
            <h4>◆ Style Guide</h4>
            I created a style guide to illustrate the typefaces,colors and various UI elements that were applied in the design
            system. I wanted to achieve a fun and interactive look to stay relevant.
            <br><img src="" alt="">
            <br>
            <h4>◆ Mockup</h4>
            We developed a high fidelity mockup that would be the base of the prototype

            <h3>Lessons learnt</h3>
            This project gave me great exposure on working on a full User Experience problem from start to completion.
            Each step was a learning opportunity and it gave me a learning foundation
