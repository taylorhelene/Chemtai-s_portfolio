            <p>
              Gunthers personal website design is the result of a project I did as a Freelancer.This study follows my journey from identifying a problem space, learning about 
              the problem, and creating a solution.
              <br>The problem: The current UI was not very pleasing or attractive to retain user attention and
              engagement as a personal website needed user retention.
            </p>
             
          </div>

          <div style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; ">
            <p>
            <h3>Process</h3>
            <br>Solution: A revamp of the website with enough details to maintain user retention and 
            engagement with emphasis on services being provided.
            <br>My Role: As a UI/UX team of one I was responsible for the :<br> ⁕Research
            <br> ⁕Ideation
            <br> ⁕Information Architechture
            <br> ⁕User Interface and visual design
            <br> ⁕Prototype development
            Through out the project, I incoporated invaluable feedback from the client.
            <br>My tools include:
            <br>✔Sticky notes      &nbsp;&nbsp;     ✔Empathy map template
            <br>✔moqup template     &nbsp;     ✔Pens  
            <br>✔Adobe XD
            <br>✔illustrator
            <h3>My Process</h3>
            My process employed a design thinking mindset, in which I focused first on learning about the problem space, through the discovery
            stages of understanding and empathy, then synthesizing what I had learned to define and frame the problem and finally creating the 
            solution.

              <h3>PHASE 1: LEARNING ABOUT THE PROBLEM </h3>
              <br>
              <h3>Understand</h3>
              
              <h4>◆Secondary research</h4>
              Looking into existing secondary research from existing personal websites
              to identify recent trends and patterns.
              <br>Looking into existing secondary research from existing web design
              to identify the UI navigation problems
              <br>
              <h4>◆Comparative analysis</h4>
              I followed up with a comparative analysis with personal websites and portfolios.
              <br>
              <h3>Empathize</h3>
              
              <h4>◆Primary research</h4>
              I moved to primary research after a good understanding of portfolio and personal website trends where I could learn directly 
              from people through interviews and one on one talks.Prior to setting this up ,I developed some goals:
              <br> ▹Address the services and accomplishments of the client 
              <br> ▹Retain interest and user engagement in the website
              <br> I had some participants to interview and gained some invaluable insight into how they would be persuaded to
              continue perusing and scrolling through a personal website and these were their thoughts:
              <br>" I would like to gain something after visiting someone's personal website"
              <br>" I don't want like an engaging look on the website"
              <br>
              <h3>Define</h3>
              <h4>◆ Affinity map</h4>
              I set to work creating an affinity map after synthesizing my research notes
              <br>Two themes emerged:
              <br>*Focus on personal details
              <br>*Focus on achievements
              <br>
              <h4>◆ Empathy maps </h4>
              I created empathy maps to organize information into what people feel.
              <br>
              <img src="" alt="">
              <br>
              <h4>◆ Persona </h4>
              Personas were created from the empathy map which included individual goals,motivations,needs
              ,motivations,frustrations and environment
              <br>
              <h4>◆ Problem statement </h4>
              Finally the synthesis of the information also gave me the opportunity to redefine the problem
              into a more adressable problem :
              <br>
              <br>
              <h3>PHASE 2: CREATING A SOLUTION </h3>
              <br>
              <h3>Ideate</h3>
            
              <h4>◆ How might we...?</h4>
              I formulated how might we questions to adress the core element.
              <br>How might we make re-design the page to attract and retain users.
              A revamp of the website with enough details to maintain user retention and 
              engagement with emphasis on services being provided.
              <br>
              <h4>◆ The idea</h4>
              <br>
              <h3>Prototype</h3>
              <h4>◆ User Stories</h4>
              The first step is building a minimum viable product using User Stories,actions and epics.
              <br>
              <h4>◆ Information architecture</h4>
              I created a general structure using a user flow diagram. The improvised revisions would be
              later added to high fidelity prototype
              <br>
              <img src="" alt="">
              <br>
              <h4>◆ Sketching</h4>
              I sketched out the onboarding and screens needed for the website and turned it into low fidelity
              prototypes
              <br>
              <h4>◆ Wireframes</h4>
              I developed some low fidelity wireframes for more editing and feedback from my teammate. Any changes
              would be noted down and changed to better revisions and wireflows
              <br>
              <img src="" alt="">
              <br>
              <h4>◆ Style Guide</h4>
              I created a style guide to illustrate the typefaces,colors and various UI elements that were applied in the design
              system. I wanted to achieve a interesting but professional look to stay relevant.
              <br><img src="" alt="">
              <br>
              <h4>◆ Mockup</h4>
              I developed a high fidelity mockup that would be the base of the prototype
              <br><img src="assets/img/portfolio/JeffGuntherfinalmockup.png" alt="">
              <br><img src="assets/img/portfolio/jeffindividualpages.png" alt="">
            </p>
            <p>
              <br>
              <h3>Lessons learnt</h3>
              This project gave me great exposure on working alone on a full User Experience problem from start to completion.
              Each step was a learning opportunity and it gave me great insights on what not to add and what should be included in professional
              websites. I did learn to go for a simple look which I incoporated in my next project.
